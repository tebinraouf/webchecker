	Abstract = {The Object Constraint Language (OCL) can be used to capture structural constraints in the context of the abstract syntax of modelling languages (metamodels) defined in the MOF metamodelling architecture. While the expression language of OCL has been revised and updated a number of times since its inception, the constructs used for capturing constraints (invariants) have remained unchanged. In this paper we argue that the abstract and concrete syntax of OCL invariants should also be updated to address a number of shortcomings and render OCL more usable in a contemporary modelling environment. To support our arguments we have implemented the proposed extensions in the prototype Epsilon Validation Language (EVL). To demonstrate the benefits delivered, we present and discuss a concrete example.},
